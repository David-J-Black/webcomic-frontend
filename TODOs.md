## TODO

- Fix double-page loading so it doesn't lurch the browser forward
  - I think we need to add on to the existing array instead of replacing it
- Get the side menu working
  - Fill up the side menu 
- Have side menu permanently on screen when resolution is huge
- If resolution isn't big enough for two pages, have it be one page wide with side menu extended
  - Make a toggle switch to users can choose to stick to one page scrolling
- Have the end of a chapter display text "End of chapter" or "Go to next chapter."
